# Examples

This directory holds frozen example documentation sets from prior projects.

Use cases:
- Compare a concrete, filled-in docs set against the template docs under `docs/`.
- Bootstrap a new project by running the interview and drafting into `docs/_draft_<project>/` without inheriting old assumptions.

Important:
- The canonical docs under `docs/` are intended to be **templates** for new projects.
- Examples are **not** authoritative for a new project unless you explicitly adopt them.

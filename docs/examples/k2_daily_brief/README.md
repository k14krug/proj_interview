# Example: K2 Daily Brief (Frozen Docs Snapshot)

This folder contains a snapshot of the prior project documentation set that originally lived under the canonical `docs/` paths.

It is preserved as an example only. Do not treat these files as authoritative for new projects unless you explicitly choose to.

Contents mirror the original structure:
- `DOCS_INDEX.md` (the original `docs/README.md` content)
- `product/`
- `architecture/`
- `workflow/`

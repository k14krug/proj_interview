Project: `<ProjectName>`
Doc Status: `template` | `draft` | `frozen`
Last Updated (UTC): `<YYYY-MM-DD>`

Goal: define screen-level behavior tied to routes and state transitions.

## 1. UI Technology

- Framework/runtime:
- Styling/token approach:
- Accessibility baseline:

## 2. App Shell

Describe shared regions (nav, header, footer) and cross-cutting UI behaviors.

## 3. Screen Inventory

| Screen ID | Name | Auth Required | Primary Routes | States (loading/empty/error/success) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SCN-001 | TBD | TBD | RT-002 | TBD |

## 4. Route-to-UI Contract Notes

For each RT-* with UI impact, define:
- trigger action
- loading behavior
- empty state copy/behavior
- error behavior (retry, message, support link)
- success behavior (toasts, navigation, state refresh)
